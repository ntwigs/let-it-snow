## FAQ

### I can't see any snow - what's happening!?
You might be visiting a site that is not supported - such as the **Chrome extension store**. It could also be that the site you're visiting is white.. and you know.. snow is white.

### Why does the extension say "Too warm"?
Well.. the site you're visiting might not support extensions - such as the **Chrome extension store**. It might also be that you need to reload the page you're currently visiting. 

### How do I access the Let it snow dropdown?
At the top right of your browser - you should see a blue little icon (that's the Let it snow icon), click that and it should show. If the icon isn't showing, there should be a "puzzle button", click that and *pin* the Let it snow icon. Now it should always be available at the top of your browser.
