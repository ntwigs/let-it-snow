## FAQ

### I can't see any snow - what's happening!?

You might be visiting a site that is not supported - such as the **Chrome extension store**. It could also be that the site you're visiting is white.. and you know.. snow is white.

### Why does the extension say "Too warm"?

Well.. the site you're visiting might not support extensions - such as the **Chrome extension store**. It might also be that you need to reload the page you're currently visiting.

### How do I access the Let it snow dropdown?

At the top right of your browser - you should see a blue little icon (that's the Let it snow icon), click that and it should show. If the icon isn't showing, there should be a "puzzle button", click that and _pin_ the Let it snow icon. Now it should always be available at the top of your browser.

### How do I make this build locally?

It should ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è be fairly straight forward to make this build locally.

1. Clone the repo to somewhere where you can find it.
2. Go to the `Let it snow` directory and run Yarn (I've used Yarn, but it could also work with NPM, no guarantees).
3. Wait for the packages to get installed.
4. If you're going to be testing - run `yarn build` and you'll get sourcemaps.
5. If you're going to create a production build - omit the sourcemaps with `yarn prod`.
6. Go to the extension manager in Chrome and activate Developer mode.
7. Press the big ol' `Load unpacked extension` and select the newly created `dist` folder in the `Let it snow` directory.
8. That should be it! If you're experiencing any issues or bugs - please open an issue.

Merry Christmas - and why the heck not - a happy new year üéÑüéÖ
